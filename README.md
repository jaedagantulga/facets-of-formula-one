Since its inception in 1950, Formula 1 has become the most popular international auto racing sport at the highest level of competition. It is sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The format of Formula 1 has two simultaneous championships during the season, the Constructors Championship and the Drivers' Championship. The Constructors Championship is determined by adding up the points for both drivers of the same team while the Drivers' Championship is won by one individual. 

In the 2022 season, there were ten teams racing with two drivers each for a total of twenty drivers competing. 

The constructors and drivers for the 2022 season included:

With the exception of Nico Hülkenberg substituting Grand Prix 1-2 for Sebastian Vettel for Aston Martin and Nyck de Vries substituting for Alexander Albon for Grand Prix 16 for Williams, all other drivers raced in all Grand Prixs.

What made the 2022 season particularly interesting was that the FIA brought on significant changes that created a large impact on both the Constructors Championship as well as the Drivers' Championship.
